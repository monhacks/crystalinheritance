I'll analyze this assembly code to explain how the fire animation works. This appears to be Game Boy/Game Boy Color assembly code (likely for a Pokémon game based on the references to "Elite Four Room").
Overview of Fire Animation System
This code animates a set of 8 fire tiles that together form a larger fire animation. Each tile cycles through its own sequence of frame tiles to create the animation effect.
Key Components

TilesetEliteFourRoom2Anim: Animation sequence table that defines what frames to show and which animation function to call
AnimateFountainTile: The function that updates a specific tile graphic in VRAM
FireFrames1-8: Defines the VRAM destination and source graphic data for each of the 8 fire tiles
FireTiles1-8: The actual graphical data for each animation frame

How the Animation Works
The animation system works as follows:

The game cycles through the TilesetEliteFourRoom2Anim table sequentially
For each entry in the table that has FireFrames data, it calls AnimateFountainTile
The AnimateFountainTile function:

Gets the VRAM address from the FireFrames data (where to place the tile)
Gets the source tile data address from FireFrames
Uses a timer value (wFountainAnimationTimer) to determine which frame to show
Copies the tile graphic data to VRAM using WriteTile



Fire Tile Layout
The 8 fire tiles are arranged in a pattern in VRAM:

Tiles $0E, $1E, $2E, $3E (first row)
Tiles $0F, $1F, $2F, $3F (second row)

This would create a 2x4 grid of tiles (16x32 pixels) for the full fire animation.
Animation Cycles
Based on the code:

The TilesetEliteFourRoom2Anim table calls all 8 fire tile animations in sequence
Each tile is updated using AnimateFountainTile
The wFountainAnimationTimer is used to select which frame to show for each tile
After all 8 fire tiles are updated, other animation functions are called (LightsAnim1, LightsAnim2, etc.)

Performance Analysis
It's difficult to give an exact cycle count without seeing the full implementation of functions like WriteTile, but I can make some observations:

The AnimateFountainTile function is called 8 times per full animation cycle (once per fire tile)
Each call to AnimateFountainTile involves:

Several memory reads to get addresses
A calculation to determine the frame offset
Copying 16 bytes (one full tile) from ROM to VRAM via WriteTile



For the Game Boy/Game Boy Color processor (Z80-like), this would likely take:

~10-20 cycles for setup and addressing
~5-10 cycles for the timer calculation
~10-15 cycles for the source address calculation
~80-160 cycles for the actual tile data transfer (16 bytes)

Total estimate per tile update: ~105-205 cycles
Total for all 8 tiles: ~840-1640 cycles per full animation frame
Since each tile can have multiple frames (determined by wFountainAnimationTimer), the full animation would cycle through these frames over time.
Interesting Technical Details

The code uses a clever technique of manipulating the stack pointer (sp) to efficiently copy tile data, which is a common performance optimization in Game Boy programming.
Each fire tile can have up to 5 frames of animation, based on the imported .2bpp files.
The fire animation is part of a larger tileset animation system that also handles fountains and lights.
The animation timer (wFountainAnimationTimer) is shifted left 4 bits (swap a) to multiply by 16, which is the byte size of one tile in Game Boy graphics.

This is a sophisticated tile animation system designed for the Game Boy's limited hardware capabilities, efficiently animating multiple tiles to create a fluid fire effect.
